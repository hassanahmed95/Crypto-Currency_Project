# Task 1 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains two separate data analysis and machine learning projects.

## Task_1 - Cryptocurrency Market Analysis

**Files:**
- `crypto_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with comprehensive cryptocurrency market analysis
- `cryptocurrency.csv` - Dataset containing cryptocurrency market data
- `AI_ML - Coding Interview Questions.docx` - Interview questions document

**Description:**
Exploratory data analysis of cryptocurrency market data using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis includes data visualization, statistical insights, and market trend analysis.

**Main Functionality:**
- Data loading and initial exploration of cryptocurrency dataset
- Statistical analysis of market trends and patterns
- Data visualization with charts and graphs
- Market cap and volume analysis
- Price movement correlation studies
- Data quality assessment and cleaning

## Task_2 - Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model

**Files:**
- `Code/` - Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training
- `Data/` - Processed dataset (`refined_data.csv`)
- `Model/` - Trained Random Forest model (`model.pkl`)
- `Reports/` - Final project report (`final_project_report.pdf`)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

**Description:**
Machine learning project that predicts cryptocurrency price movements using Random Forest classifier. The model uses features like 24h change, 7d change, and volume-to-market cap ratio to predict future price direction.

**Main Functionality:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Feature selection (24h change, 7d change, volume-to-market cap ratio)
- Random Forest model training and validation
- Model performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
- Future price movement prediction (up/down classification)
- Model persistence and deployment preparation
- Comprehensive model evaluation and reporting

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r Task_2/requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis
3. Execute the machine learning pipeline in Task_2/Code/

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
